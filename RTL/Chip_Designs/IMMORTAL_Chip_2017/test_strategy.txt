testing strategy:


RTL tests:

	* 1st round (using traffic generators):		
		.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
		|* reconfigure the routers in the beginning (this will increase the coverage for LBDRs and NI):			|	Done	|	
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* Read NI FLAG register																				|	Done	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* Read NI counter register																				|	Done	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* Read self diagnosis info 																			|	Done	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* Send diagnosis packets to SHMU																		|	Done	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* send packets to all other nodes 																		|	Done	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* inject faults in FIFO input and LBDR input to take them into packet drop mode 						|	Done	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* test all the states of counter threshold 															|	Done 	|
		|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
		|* test all the arbiter cases																			|  Pending	|
		'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'

	* 2nd round (using plasma's behavioral memory content from file):
		* some dummy faults should be injected via iJTAG that enables a turn fault in the SHMU 
			* to do so, read the flags in the NI and if the flag is set, read NI_self_diagnosis_address: "000000000000000010000000000011"
			* the side effect is that we test the sibs
		* try firing all the checkers in one router via iJTAG fault injection
		* sending packets to all other nodes, without waiting for specific packets to receive 
		  (during this time we can inject faults):
			* real faults (via modelsim force command) should be injected on the links to test all the cases of FIFO packet drop and the counter threshold:
				* some links should go faulty... which should be restored later (this will cover the transition from healthy 
				  to intermittent and faulty)
				* some links should go intermittent and back to healthy 
			* real faults (via modelsim force command) should be injected on the LBDR input to test the LBDR packet drop mechanism
		* start syncing packets (wait for a packet and then re-route it)
		* test GPIO
		* run plasma test program and use UART


	* 3rd round:
		* pre-load verilog memory from file and send packets in the network (the rest should already work!). log via UART!

	* 4th round:
		* try writing simple application (sending packets to other nodes) into verilog-memory via iJTAG. log via UART!
	
Post-synthesis tests:
	* write into Plasma Memory via iJTAG
		* test UART (if it works, try getting out the other test results from UART)
			* for this we need a UART reciever for the testbench! maybe re-use the plasma UART
		* test NoC packet sending (sent and recieved packets should be recorded via UART), not many packets are required, 
		  each node should be able to send to all others
		* test GPIO

Post-layout tests:
	* re-do Post-synthesis tests!
